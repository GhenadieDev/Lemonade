## 🚀 How it works

   - When the app launches, you see a **lemon tree**.  
   - Tap the tree to select a lemon.  

2. **Squeeze the lemon** ✋  
   - After tapping the tree, a lemon appears.  
   - Tap it **2–4 times** (random each round) to squeeze the juice.  

3. **Enjoy your lemonade** 🥤  
   - Once squeezed, you’ll see a **glass of lemonade**.  
   - Tap the glass to drink it.  

4. **Start again** 🔄  
   - After drinking, an **empty glass** appears.  
   - Tap it to go back to the lemon tree and repeat the process.
